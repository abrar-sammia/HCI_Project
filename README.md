This is for the CPSC 481: Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Calgary Course Project. 

# Project Idea
We intend to develop a guide for amateur gardeners to shape their nurseries and backyards into something they can be proud of. This will generally be accomplished using gardening tips, processes, seasonal advice etc. to help the gardener come to their own decisions, giving them the confidence and allowing their garden to reflect themselves. Our app is intended to be used as a focal tool for all gardeners, for example to compare prices in local stores or to see gardening processes for specific types of plants.
